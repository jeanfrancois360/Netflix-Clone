# Netflix-Clone 
This React project has multiple pages: Home, Browse (which uses Firebase authentication), sign in, and sign up.
The sign in will connect to Firebase when a user tries to sign in, and when a user signs up, we will use Firebase
auth to store the user in the Firebase auth database. I built this app using React and uses Styled Components for
all the styling we implement. In the project I use Fuse.js for live search, and I test all the components using React Testing Library.
And of course I use React router for navigation!
